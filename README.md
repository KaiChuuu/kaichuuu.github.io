## New Project Details

New projects should have the tag 'project'.

Extra tags are listed in `/data/TopicGroupings.tsx`.

Each project should have **1** tag in `techStackGroup`,  
and can have as many tags in `projectKeywords`.

If you want the project to be in "Active Demos" section,  
add a link to the demo in the "Website" key of the github project.
